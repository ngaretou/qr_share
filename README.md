## QR Code Viewer

### This small web app provides a QR code viewer you can upload to your web server. 

Example at [qr.sng.al](https://qr.sng.al): 

<div align="center">
<img src="https://qr.sng.al/screenshots/shot2.png" alt="light mode" width="300" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="https://qr.sng.al/screenshots/shot1.png" alt="dark mode" width="300" />
<p><i>Light mode & Dark mode</i></p>
</div>

### To make it yours: 

* Download this repository. 

* Create your QR codes with your preferred method or via [QR Code Monkey](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/)

* Download the QR codes and place them in the `images` folder, replacing the existing codes. 

* Go into `cards.js` and edit the card data & edit the `pageTitle` to your desired name. This is the only file you have to edit. 

* Save `cards.js`, upload the entire contents of the folder to your web server, and share. 

  * [If you like you can zip up the folder and upload it as a .zip file, then extract, this is more efficient.]

### If you do not have a web server

You can use GitHub Pages to host your QR code viewer: [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
